	<h1>Welcome to GMOD Prime.</h1>
	<p id="subtitle">The newest way to discover your favorite Garry's Mod servers.</p>
	<br /><hr><br />
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>As most people who have played Garry's Mod (or any source game really) can tell you, the default server browser could use some work. Unless you happen upon a 
	server online (via Facepunch or something similar), finding a server is trivial at best. Searches via the server browser can be filtered by map, V.A.C. protection,
	amount of players, and password protection - the only other thing you can do is scroll through the results until you see a server that looks good. Team Fortress 2
	took a step in the right direction with their new "Find Server" menu, and although the only option is the type of gamemode you'd like to play, the game itself does a 
	good enough job at filtering the results that no further interaction is needed. This has its downsides as well, however. The gamemode option is restricted to official
	gamemodes only, which means that anybody wanting to play a custom gamemode is left to use the legacy browser.</p>
	<br />
	<p>Garry's Mod also has a new server browser. Unlike Team Fortress, GMod is an indie game, which means that there are no official servers, and only one or two official 
	gamemodes. Instead, the new browser features player-created gamemodes, sorted by the number of servers playing that gamemode and the number of players playing on that 
	server. It sounds pretty good on paper, but in practice, the server browser leaves much to be desired. Newer/smaller gamemodes get lost in the mix, player counts are 
	often wrong, and some servers just don't show up at all. Many players have requested updates to the browser, but with all the changes going on behind the scenes, it 
	seems to have taken a backseat to more important issues. There is of course the legacy browser, but with no option to search by gamemode, probably the most important 
	feature, players are almost better off searching on the internet for a server to play on. That's where GMOD Prime comes in.</p>
